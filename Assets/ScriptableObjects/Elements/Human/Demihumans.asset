  description: 'Failed attempts in Polymorphy lead to humans having limbs or traits
    of animals, some of which were capable of having children.

    For the parents
    these animal parts where more often than not a buren as they were mostly just
    results from experiements.

    Supprisingly though when a child inherited an
    animal limb or trait that part was often well fused with the human body and most
    of the time all the negaitves that came with the failed experiement were gone.'
