  description: 'Putting a human soul in a Golem is highly shunned by the magic community
    as it requires, like many soul art, the painfull extraction of a human soul leading
    to death.

    However in the few cases where it has been done in secret and
    the resulting monsters did not cease existing shortly after its creation a Homunculus
    was created.

    Homunculus are unlike golems self sufficient as the soul produces
    insane amounts of magic which keeps the body running. However this much magic
    is created by the soul slowly falling appart and therefore Homunculus burn bright
    but not very long.
