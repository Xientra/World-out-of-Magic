  description: 'Was eventual discovered by the attempts at healing and ressurecting
    humans. It was also found out that animals and monsters also posses a soul but
    the soul of humans was almost always a lot greater.

    It is speculated that
    a soul becomes greater by knowledge and emotions that the body experiances as
    childs of humans, animals and monsters all have a very fickle soul.'
