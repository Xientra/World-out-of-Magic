  description: 'Was eventual discovered by the attempts at healing and ressurecting
    humans. It was also found out that animals and monsters also posses a soul but
    the soul of humans was almost always a lot greater.

    Experiments found that
    children of both humans and other species have a lot weaker souls and that they
    grow over time.

    It is speculated that knowledge and emotions a human experiences
    are the things that make their soul stronger.'
