  description: 'Jungle, unlike normal forests have been artificially, magically enhanced
    by someone or something in the past. This is usually done to guard something
    like a temple that should be forgotten by the world or the hord of a Dragon that
    should never be touched by anyone.

    Jungles are not inherently magic like
    Fey Forests, nor are they a monster like Living Plants but magic has increased
    the vitatily of the plants and animals and shaped the environment to be more
    dangerous.'
