  description: 'A larger fairy very similar to humans in apperance but often described
    as a lot more beatuiful.

    However similar in apperance they are very different
    from humans posessing innate magical abilities similar to mutants or druids and
    rely very little on tools or housing.

    The few tool they are using like the
    bow have likely been modeled after the human items however the quality of any
    elven tools greatly exceeds what humans can create.

    They are way fewer in
    numbers than humans and do not possess kingdoms or even cities. Most commenly
    they are in small groups that form hunting groups or a tiny village.
