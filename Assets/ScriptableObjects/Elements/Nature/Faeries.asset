  description: 'Faeries are tiny humanoids with wings that often look like butterfly
    wings but in reality can be whatever the wants.

    That is due to them being
    manifestations of the combined magic that nature holds in it. Once they manifest
    they are theoretically indipendent from the place that happened but places where
    that can happen are rare any a lot of faeries stay and protect them.


    Faeries
    are very chaotic in nature and love to play around and do tricks on humans. But
    they feel no empathy sometimes they have fun on the cost of human lifes.


    They
    only die if their magic runs out and that can only happen if their spend it all
    at once or they don''t visit a place of sufficient nature in multiple years.

    That
    means they are technically immortal but that is contrasted by the fact that faeries
    almost not learn at all and then stay the same for all eternity.'
