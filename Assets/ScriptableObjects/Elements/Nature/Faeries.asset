  description: 'Faeries are tiny humanoids with wings that look like butterfly wings.

    They
    are a manifestations of the all magic that nature holds, centered in one being.
    As such they theoretically have compleate controll over their aperance but little
    change theirs drasically.

    They manifest in places, where a lot of natura
    magic is very strong close together but such places are rare.

    Once they
    manifest they are theoretically indipendent from the place that happen but a
    lot of faeries stay there and protect them.


    Faeries are very chaotic in
    nature and love to play around and do tricks on humans. But they feel no empathy,
    so sometimes they have fun at the cost of human lifes.


    They only die if
    their magic runs out and that can only happen if their spend it all at once or
    they don''t visit a place of sufficient nature in multiple years.

    That means
    they are technically immortal but faeries have a contrasting big downfall: they
    don''t learn. They stay the way they are when they are born for all of eternity
    not learning and not developing allways having the same childish attitude they
    had at the beninning.'
