  description: 'Cats are together with dogs and horses one of the closest companions
    to humans.

    Cats take the role of the guardians.


    They are of course
    far less obidient than dogs or horses but cats have a unique affinity to magic.
    They seem to see things that humans can''t, like when a person is sick or afflicted
    with corruption and many humans belive they keep evil spirits away.

    Cats
    are also very perceptive to magical energy even very far away. Not only that
    but they can also sense intention of monsters. This mean they can warn humans,
    when a dangerous monster is in the area or about to attack and that makes cats
    play a very important role in the humans defence against monsters.

    Generally
    speaking a place with a cat is a save place.


    Wizards are also very fond
    of cats and the other way around. Cats are attracted to everything magical and
    their reactions help wizards get a grasp on certian magical effects.'
