  description: 'Dogs are together with cats and horses one of the closest companions
    to humans.


    With their great tracking skills and high speed they are invaluable
    for hunting and with their paralyzing bark and high resilience they are incredible
    helpfull in the fight against monsters.


    Every dog has these abilities and
    develops them on their own but with the help of humans dogs can become stronger
    than common monsters.


    For unknown the paralizing bark reasons only works
    on monsters. It can intimidate and confuse animals and humans but for monsters
    the effect quite literally freezes them in place for up to a few seconds. This
    of course can intimidate and confuse the monsters as well and is quite a strong
    ability.'
