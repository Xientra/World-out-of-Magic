  description: 'Horses are together with cats and dogs one of the closest companions
    to humans.


    Humans do not have giant kingdom but even what they have now
    would have been impossible to achieve without horses.

    Horses are the most
    imporant in two areas.

    The first is everywhere, where the human strength
    reaches its limits, for example in plowing a field or pulling a carriage.

    The
    second of course is transport. Materials and persons.

    There is movement
    enhanching and even teleporting magic but a horse can move incredible fast and
    long even without magic.


    That though does not mean it has no magical abilities.
    Allthough they are not as important to humans and not every horse develops them,
    horses can, like dogs, become quite strong.


    The strongest ability is Dash,
    where the horse creates an air tunnel around it, that enables it to move a lot
    faster. Everything and everyone on the outside of the air tunnel, that is hit
    by it forcefully thrown aside and destroyed.

    This goes as far as some eilte
    horses of the humans being able to ride straight through a forest destroying
    or throwing every tree in the way aside.

    A variation of this ability is
    to run on water, but it has little maneuverability and the horse cannot stop
    running or else it will fall. This makes it unusable for longer journeys across
    waters, that require breaks but it is very usefull in combat, where it opens
    up a whole region to escape to or attact from.'
