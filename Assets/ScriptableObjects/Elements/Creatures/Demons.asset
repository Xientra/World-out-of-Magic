  description: 'Demons are the offspring of humans and humanoid monsters.

    Just
    like monsters these creatures posses the same unlimited potential for growth
    but with a greater interlect they are even more dangerous.

    Demons are, like
    monsters, innately evil. Then do have human connections for example to their
    parents but they are still verycruel.

    And humans treat them as such. Demons
    are pursued and killed whenever their birth is heard of, not improving the human
    demon relations overall.'
