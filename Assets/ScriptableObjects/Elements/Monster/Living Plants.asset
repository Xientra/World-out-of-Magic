  description: "There are many different forms of living plants and the line between
    them and fey, like for example treants or Dryads is often very blury.\nLiving
    Plants however are distinct in that they have the characteristics of monsters
    that fey do not. Namely praying on Humans and being of generelly lower inteligence.
    \nEven though they do have the ability to walk, burror or in general move around
    they most of the time disguise themselfs among regular plants and then wait until
    potential pray walkes into their ambush."
