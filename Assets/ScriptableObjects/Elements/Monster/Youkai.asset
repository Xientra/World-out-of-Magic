  description: 'Youkai invisible to most humans. Only mediums can see them reliable
    and even then there are better and worse mediums.

    Cats also appear to see
    them.


    What youkai are doing is completely unkown. They either run away
    if they notice someone can see them or they become hostile and attack the medium.


    They
    have no influence on their surroundings if not provoked by something.


    Somtimes
    at dawn youkai become visible for a brief moment, which creates a lot of rumors
    and stories.'
