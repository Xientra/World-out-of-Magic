  description: 'Dragons are one of the most feared monsters even though dragons are
    not actualy much different to other monsters.

    The one things that is special
    about dragons is that they are the only othere creature on this world other than
    humans, which is greedy. And dragons are immensly greedy. The word greed was
    originaly invented for dragons and only later used for humans as well even though
    it suits them really good as well.

    Any monster would be as feared and as
    stong as dragons are if it would life as long but a lot of them don''t or at
    least not nearly in the same amount as dragons do.


    Most die because of
    other monsters, because of humans or because they can''t find enougth food anymore.

    Dragons
    have the same problems but dragons are greedy. They will amass terretory, land,
    gold and tresure as soon as they can, giving them not only their own physical
    strength but also material strength.

    With this they can overcome the filter
    that stops most monsters from becoming incredible powerfull a lot more easily.

    That
    filter is a time in most monsters life, where they become incredible hungry and
    need a lot more food. The problem is at that point they are not strong enought
    to also obtain that.


    Because of this there are a lot more ancient dragons
    than there are other ancient monsters but most ancient dragons hide in their
    lairs on their pile of treasure so they are not that of a threat.

    What make
    dragons so scary is again their greed. Especially younger ones, which just emerged
    from the weaker average monsters do everything they can think of in their cunning
    mind to acquire gold and other tresure. Often also conversing with humans and
    just as often betraying them.


    [Idk bring the fact that people have to bring
    tribute to them in here as well]
