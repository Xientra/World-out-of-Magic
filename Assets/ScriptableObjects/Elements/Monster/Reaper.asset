  description: 'The Reaper, a skelletal figure in a black hood wielding a scythe.

    Due
    to his appearance and immense power it is wildly assumed that he is actualy a
    Lich however is very different in behaviour to other Lich as he never talks and
    lacks and vile and selfish intentions.

    He is more like a unstoppable force
    of nature than an individual.

    He appears whenever many humans are dying
    and is seen as the worst omen imaginable.

    Many soliders tell to have seen
    him on the battlefield where he claims the souls of those fallen.'
