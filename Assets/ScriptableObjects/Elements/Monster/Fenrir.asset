  description: 'Fenrir are Wolf like monsters, arguably the most numerous in nature
    and at the same time one of the most dangerous to humans.


    There exist many
    type of Fenrir some that merge with shadows some with mutiple heads and some
    that walk on two legs.

    Also as with every monster they can gain in strength
    indefinitely however there are not many really strong Fenrir compared to how
    many there are in total.'
