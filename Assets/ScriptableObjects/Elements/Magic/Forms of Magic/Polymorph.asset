  description: 'This form of magic focuses on transmuting flesh, plants and live
    itself.

    It formed out of the attempts at creating magic capable of healing.
    Although that is its main purpose Polymorth magic can only do minor things, like
    closing wounds or curing headache.

    effects, like numbing pain.'
