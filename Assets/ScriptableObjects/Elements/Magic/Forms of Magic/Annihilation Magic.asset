  description: 'The most destructive and most dangerous kind of magic to ever exist.

    This
    magic uses the destruction of a soul as a startingpoint creating immense magical
    power. But that is not what makes it so dangerous. When a living being is killed
    by this magic its soul is destroyed and turned into more magic energy fueling
    the Annihilaiton Magic even further, creating a possible infinite feedbackloop
    with monsterous capabilities.

    Thankfully this kind of magic is so complicated
    that any attempts of humans to use it have failed in the past only the titans
    that roamed the earth aeons ago are said to have used this kind of magic.'
