  description: 'Originally called Magic Manipulation Magic, this school of magic
    is about the manipulation of the very reality that is made up out of magic around
    us.


    It not ony enables teleportation but is also able to increase the size
    of a bag or stretch hallways into the infinite. But as the most central use is
    that of teleportation it is commonly simply refered to as Teleportation Magic.


    Even
    though it was discovered very early on, due to it''s complex nature it is incredibly
    hard to master and only a few things besides teleportation are worth the time
    and effort it takes to learn it. And so very very few people focus entirely on
    Magic Manipulation Magic.'
