  description: 'Creating a immense magic circle on the ground shimmering in golden
    white light.

    Any human in that circle has increased stamina and physical
    strength and can not die. They can suffer from deadly wounds and pass out but
    as long as the spell is active simply healing the wounds will keep anyone alive.'
