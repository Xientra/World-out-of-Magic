  description: 'A highly learned spell for all elemental mages even though it has
    very high magic consumption in relation to it''s actual strength.

    Normally
    using fireball has a much higher magic to effectiveness ratio.

    However the
    big strength of Lighting Strike is that if you do put enought magic in it it
    will hit the opponent no matter what and is impossible to evade.'
