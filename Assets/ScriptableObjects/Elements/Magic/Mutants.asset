  description: 'Some humans innately posses more magic in them than others.

    This
    can just be how they are born or they came in contract with something that changed
    them in that way.

    Mutans are very rare and while having a lot of magic can
    be very powerfull it is also very agonizing and many mutans eventualy become
    monsters and are hunted.

    Due to this mutans are often feared and disliked.'
